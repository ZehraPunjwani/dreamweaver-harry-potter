      <p><a href="Initial plan.xlsx">Intial plan:</a> This  contains the plan which was made by myself at the beginning of the project to help me throughot my project. This is a big project, therefore I had to plan carefully to make sure that I finish everything and meet the deadline. to make sure i was organised I produced a detailed project plan which was done up-front before I started working on the tasks, as a plan produced afterwards would not have gained any marks, it's very important to have a workable plan at the start so I could look back at my plan before asking help from others, and also  it was perfectly acceptable to change the plan as I went along, so long as I explained why. I had to also get it marked and accepted by the teacher, making sure all aspects are perfectly fine, reasonable and is aimed at the right audince. </p>
      <p>Ongoing plan: This is simply filled throughout the project and is the second stage of the intial plan which contains everything on what I did, how long I took and how did the task go. At the end of every session I had to use my ongoing plan to check my progress. I could not make any changes to the initial plan as that was a proof off what i had decided before i began the project. The ongoing plan basically tells us what changes did I make to the initial plan. This is a big project, therefore i had to plan carefully to make sure that I finish everything and meet the deadline. I could not make changes to the initial plan. I produced a detailed  ongoing plan which was a copy of the intial plan, however it contains a little more information on what I did through out the project i.e  time spent, Contingency timing and any other comments and notes given on the contingency timing and overall on the project. </p>
      <p>Project review: This is an overall powerpoint based review of my project, it explains all the comments which i used throughout this course. it also containes detailed description on what i did and then how did i improve it. Project Review was that not so easy as i had to carry out a review of the whole project. I had to ask my teacher and other end-of-project reviewers to evaluate my finished products. I kept a record of what they say so that I can use it in my project review. I also had to Produce a project review using the review notes, the mark alerts and my design log to help me. In teh project review i had to include comments on what could be improved, making use of feedback from my teacher and other end-of-project reviewers      </p>
