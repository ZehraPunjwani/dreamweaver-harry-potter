    <div align="center" class="style10">
      <p class="style15"><strong><em>Click here for:</em></strong></p>
      <p class="style15">Map: The map is the main screen of the treasure hunt. Players will access the instructions, each task, the ending screen and the coding sheet via the map. The map could have been anything I liked, it did not have to have roads on it! However it was cucial that it reflected the theme of the treasure hunt and gave players visual clues to what they will encounter for each task.</p>
      <p class="style15">Instructions screen: I had to design and create the instructions screen. It  includes information about the theme of the treasure hunt, the aim - to <span class="style2">find the combination, </span>how to use the map - where the links/hotspots are, the three tasks and the order they should be tackled, the case-sensitive combination - any letters must be capitals, the coding sheet which players can print and use to record the combination numbers and letters- here i had to make sure i reach teh requirement, what players should do when they think they have found the combination</p>
      <p class="style15">Task 1: Puzzles: To complete Task 1 players must solve a series of puzzles. Correct answers will generate the first part of the combination. The task consists of three differnt puzzles guess the object - such as photographs of parts of objects from unusual angles, guess the sound and spot the differences. The puzzles are designed keeping in mind teh audince and are relevant to the chosen theme. The puzzles also consist of assets from primary sources; those of secondary sources have been clearly evidenced in the assets table as secondary sources are copyright-free. During task 1, I have produced a story board for the puzzels and then have gone onto making the actual puzzle. </p>
      <p class="style15">Task 2: Animation: To complete Task 2 players must watch a short animation and answer a number of questions about what they have seen and heard. Correct answers will generate the next part of the combination. The questions are provided as a separate link from the map. I produced a proper animation. Making sure I know what this means. I had to make sure it is proparly designes as a still image moving across the screen would not have been enough! The animation is related to thechosen theme, it runs for between 30 and 60 seconds, it does not include any credits, it is in format which can be played through a web browser or media player, It is not produced using presentation software and lastly it complys with copyright </p>
      <p class="style15">Questions for Task 2: In Task 2 players must watch a short animation and answer a number of questions about what they have seen and heard.Correct answers will generate the next part of the combination. Some questions asked for task 2 include.....................</p>
      <p class="style15">Task3: The Movie: To complete Task 3 players must watch a short movie and then answer questions about it. Correct answers will generate the last part of the combination. The questions must appear at the end of the movie. The movieis related to thechosen theme, it consists of still images, it includes a voiceover you have produced
        <!--A hint on suggestions for soundtrack would be useful -->
        yourself, it runs for between 40 and 60 seconds before the questions appear, it also runs automatically without user input and lastly it complys with copyright. The voiceover is clear, it lasts for the duration of the movie and also it be synchronised with the images</p>
      <p class="style15">Coding sheet: This is a sheet which players can print and use to record the combination numbers and letters................................</p>
      <p class="style15">Ending: Clicking a link on the map will run a movie which allows players to enter their combination. While making this I had to make sure that i haev entered the correct combination so that when player open the link it works perfectly and that then there are no problems. I also had to make sure that every component is saved in the hiden treasure folder so that alll liniks work proparly and that nothing is missing.      </p>
